\description{
Provides weights on simulated scenarios from a baseline stochastic model, such that (i) a stressed model component fulfills a moment constraint and scenario weights minimize a selected divergence to the baseline model, or (ii) a stressed model fulfills a divergence constraint and scenario weights maximize the moment of a model component. Case (i) is obtained by specifying the moment parameter '\code{m}', case (ii) by specifying the divergence constraint '\code{theta}'.

\details{
When the argument \code{m} is specified, \code{stress_mean_div} solves the problem

\deqn{min_W E(h(W))}
under the constraints
\deqn{W>=0, }

The moment constraints are given by \code{E^Q( f(x) ) = m},where \code{E^Q} denotes the expectation under the stressed model. \code{stress_moment} solves the subsequent set of equations with respect to theta, using \code{\link[nleqslv]{nleqslv}} from package \code{\link[nleqslv]{nleqslv}}:

\deqn{E^Q( f(x) ) = E( f(x) * exp(theta * f(x)) ) = m.}

When the argument \code{theta} is specified, \code{stress_mean_div} solves the problem

There is no guarantee that the set of equations has a solution, or that the solution is unique. \code{SWIM} will
return a warning if the termination code provided by \code{nleqslv} is
different from 1 (convergence has been achieved). It is recommended to
check the result of the call to \code{nleqslv} using the "show" argument. The
user is referred to the \code{\link[nleqslv]{nleqslv}} documentation for
further details.

The stressed moment \code{m} must be in the range of \code{f(x)}.

The divergence value \code{theta} must be between 0 and \code{max.div=div(0) * (1 - 1 / n) + div(n) / n}, where \code{div} is the divergence function and \code{n} is the number of simulations (rows of \code{x}).

The function \code{f} operates on the columns of \code{x} indexed by the vector \code{k} to determine the values of the variable \code{Z}. By default \code{Z} is the first column of \code{x}.

For a user specified divergence, the additional argument \code{div.usr} must be passed. When a user divergence function is chosen, a named list containing at least the following objects: a function 'inv' giving the inverse of the first derivative of the divergence; a numeric 'div0' giving the the derivative at 0 of the divergence (possibly -Inf); when 'theta' is specified (divergence constraint), a function 'div' giving the divergence. Optionally, a function 'd.div' specifying the first derivative of the divergence. The divergence function must be one for which ###########

For the "\code{Alpha}" divergence, the numeric parameter "\code{alpha}" must be provided (when \code{alpha=1} the KL divergence is used; when \code{alpha=2}, the \code{Chi2} divergence is used; when \code{alpha=0} the \code{revKL} divergence is used).

The following dievrgences are considered:

Chi2

\deqn{h(x)=x^2-1}

Kullback-Leibler

\deqn{h(x)=}

reverse Kullback-Leibler

\deqn{h(x)=}

Hellinger

\deqn{h(x)=}

Alpha

\deqn{h(x)=}

with two elements, the starting values for the coefficients lambda1 and lambda2. Defaults to div$d.div(1) and 0 respectively, guaranteeing that the initial set of scenario weights is constant.
