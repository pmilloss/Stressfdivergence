\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector, matrix or data frame containing realizations of random variables. Columns of \code{x} correspond to random variables; OR \cr
A \code{SWIM} object, where \code{x} corresponds to the underlying data of the \code{SWIM} object.}

\item{f}{A function that, applied to columns of \code{x}, generates the values of the variable that will satisfy a mean constraint (and the divergence will be minimized) or whose mean will be maximized (under a divergence constraint). By default it is the identity function.}

\item{k}{A vector indicating which columns of \code{x} the function \code{f} operates on. By default, the first column is selected.}

\item{m}{Numeric, the stressed moments of \code{f(x)}. Must be in the range of \code{f(x)}.}

\item{theta}{Numeric, the stressed divergence of the model. The range of possible divergence values goes from 0 to \code{max.div=div(0) * (1 - 1 / n) + div(n) / n}, where \code{div} is the divergence function and \code{n} is the number of simulations (rows of \code{x}).}

\item{dvg}{Character. One of "\code{Chi2}", "KL", "revKL", Hellinger", "Alpha", "Triangular", "LeCam" or "user". For a user specified divergence, see the additional list 'div.usr' that must be passed. For the "Alpha" divergence, the numeric parameter "alpha" must be provided (when alpha is 1 the KL divergence is used; when alpha is 2, the Chi2 divergence is used). +++++++++++++++++++ADD EQUATIONS FOR THE DIVERGENCES+++++++++++++++++}

\item{div.usr}{When a user divergence function is chose, a named list containing at least the following objects: a function 'inv' giving the inverse of the first derivative of the divergence; a numeric 'div0' giving the the derivative at 0 of the divergence (possibly -Inf); when 'theta' is specified (divergence constraint), a function 'div' giving the divergence. Optionally, a function 'd.div' specifying the first derivative of the divergence. The divergence function must be one for which ###########}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. The 'alpha' parameter when the Alpha divergence is used.}

\item{normalise}{Logical. If true, values of \code{f(x)} are linearly scaled to the unit interval. Not used when 'theta' is specified.}

\item{show}{Logical. If true, print the result of the call to \code{\link[nleqslv]{nleqslv}}.}

\item{names}{Character vector, the names of stressed models.}

\item{start}{A numeric vector with two elements, the starting values for the coefficients lambda1 and lambda2. Defaults to div$d.div(1) and 0 respectively, guaranteeing that the initial set of scenario weights is constant.}

\item{sumRN}{Logical. If true, the scenario weights are normalized so as to average to 1.}

\item{log}{Logical, the option to print weights' statistics.}

\item{use.jac}{Logical, should the Jacobian matrix be used in the call to \code{\link[nleqslv]{nleqslv}}. Set to TRUE when a user divergence is used and the argument div.usr$d.div is provided.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to \code{\link[nleqslv]{nleqslv}}.}

\value{
A named list

\description{
Provides weights on simulated scenarios from a baseline stochastic model, such that (i) a stressed model component fulfills a moment constraint and scenario weights minimize a selected divergence to the baseline model, or (ii) a stressed model fulfills a divergence constraint and scenario weights maximize the moment of a model component. Case (i) is obtained by specifying the moment parameter '\code{m}', case (ii) by specifying the divergence constraint '\code{theta}'.
}
\details{
The moment constraints are given by \code{E^Q( f(x) ) = m},where \code{E^Q} denotes the expectation under the stressed model. \code{stress_moment} solves the subsequent set of equations with respect to theta, using \code{\link[nleqslv]{nleqslv}} from package \code{\link[nleqslv]{nleqslv}}:

\deqn{E^Q( f(x) ) = E( f(x) * exp(theta * f(x)) ) = m.}

There is no guarantee that the set of equations has a solution, or that the solution is unique. \code{SWIM} will
return a warning if the termination code provided by \code{nleqslv} is
different from 1 (convergence has been achieved). It is recommended to
check the result of the call to \code{nleqslv} using the "show" argument. The
user is referred to the \code{\link[nleqslv]{nleqslv}} documentation for
further details.
